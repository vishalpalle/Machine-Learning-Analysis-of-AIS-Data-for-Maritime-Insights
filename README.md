# Machine-Learning-Analysis-of-AIS-Data-for-Maritime-Insights
This project analyzes AIS vessel data using eight ML algorithms. Each model addresses a specific use caseâ€”e.g., route prediction, anomaly detection, or vessel classification. Data is preprocessed (cleaning, feature engineering), models implemented, and evaluated with metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and RMSE.
